# Theme Kit Access Tokens

Shopify introduced a workflow around providing developers with access tokens that provide access to theme actions only. We've introduced support for these access tokens. This feature does not have a outwardly facing API, rather it should be something that just works.

- You can read more about it in Shopify Docs [here](https://shopify.dev/themes/tools/theme-kit/access#how-theme-kit-access-works)
- The Shopify Application that provides these tokens can be found [here](https://apps.shopify.com/theme-kit-access)

These Theme Kit Access Tokens start off with "`shptka_`"
