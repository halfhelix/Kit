# Theme Naming

There is functionality included that renames the Shopify theme after a deployment. We use this functionality to help create a two-way bind between the theme and the deployment (when not using the Shopify Github integration).

The [Settings > Theme Name](/settings/theme-name/) elaborates on this functionality by outlining relevant configuration settings.
