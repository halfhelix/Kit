# Half Helix / Kit

This is a toolkit that we use internally at Half Helix to develop our frontend Shopify themes. It enables us to develop websites the way that we want to, with a focus on modularity. We developed this tool for our own team but hey, we thought that there might be other people out there that could enjoy this so we made it public.

> This package is currently in Beta. It is likely to change quickly as we prepare it for initial release.

### Installation

```
npm i -g @halfhelix/kit
```

### Documentation

Documentation for this tool is available at [kit.halfhelix.com](https://kit.halfhelix.com)
